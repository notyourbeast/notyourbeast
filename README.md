## 💡 About Me

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Mindset** | **Founder-Engineer.** I see code as leverage to automate inefficient systems. The goal isn't just to write software, but to architect **self-sustaining, zero-maintenance processes** that compound value. Every line of code is measured by the system it replaces or optimizes. |

## 📝 Operating Principles

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| ✅ | **Default to Clarity.** Ambiguity is the highest cost in engineering. Document and communicate systems with absolute precision. |
| ✅ | **Automate or Delete.** If a task is repeatable, it must be automated. If a process cannot be automated, question its necessity. |
| ✅ | **Measure Impact.** Focus effort only on initiatives that drive the highest leverage and measurable product or business outcomes. |
