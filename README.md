## About Me
I’m Sai — a founder and automation-focused engineer currently building Webibook and preparing for my MSc in Information Systems with Computing.  
My work sits at the intersection of **systems design**, **automation**, and **cloud engineering** — with a product mindset shaped by shipping fast and staying close to user problems.

I prefer minimal design, clean logic, and quietly powerful products.

<br/>

## Currently Building
### Webibook — Founder  
A modern way to discover and book live-learning sessions — designed to feel effortless, structured, and creator-centric.

**Focus areas:**  
- event discovery  
- creator ops  
- automation pipelines  
- clean dashboards  

---

### Client Ops Desk  
A compact, Notion-like operational workspace purpose-built for freelancers and agencies.

**Core values:** clarity, simplicity, zero noise.

<br/>

## Philosophy
I build with deliberate simplicity.  
I automate whenever possible.  
I document everything.  
I believe clarity compounds.

Good engineering isn’t loud — it’s quietly reliable.
