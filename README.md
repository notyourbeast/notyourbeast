🧱 Saiprasad “Sai” Shiragave
Founder • Automation Engineer • MSc Information Systems with Computing @ Dublin Business School (2025–26)
Currently building Webibook, shipping automation systems, and preparing for AWS + industry research.




🚀 What I'm Building Right Now
1. Webibook (Founder — 2024 → )
The “BookMyShow for learning.”
A platform to help people discover, book, and attend live learning events — with automation, AI, and creator tools.
AI-curated learning events
Creator dashboards + analytics
Smart discovery engine
Built in 4 sprints, shipping weekly
Target: Beta launch early 2025
Tech: Next.js · Node.js · MongoDB · AWS · Automation Pipelines
2. Automation & Web Development Agency
Objective: Hit $10k/month profit by 2026
Working with founders, freelancers, and SMEs to build:
client dashboards
internal automations
AI agents for workflows
clean production UIs
websites that convert — not just look pretty
3. AI + Cloud Engineering Track
AWS Cloud Practitioner → Solutions Architect Associate
RAG Optimization (research focus)
Automation workflows
Docker + CI/CD pipelines
Advanced system architecture
My goal is simple: operate like an engineer who can build like a team of three.
🧠 Why I Build
YC-style clarity:
People don’t need more apps
They need systems that make their lives easier
They need automation
They need speed
They need clarity
They need tools that remove friction, not add features
Everything I build follows this philosophy.
